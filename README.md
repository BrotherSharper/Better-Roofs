## **ATTENTION: Wall off the edges of your map for the masking to work!**

**Better Roofs Modes**:

* **Show:** only show the tile through the fog when the token is in range

* **Hide:** When a token has vision inside the roof the whole roof is hidden (uses the occlusion alpha for transparency)

* **Mask:** The fancy mode, masks what you can see from the roof tile

**Room Preview**

You can enable the building preview in the settings to show you what the building detection has deemed to be a building when you open a tile's config 

**Tolerance**

The option has been depreciated in favor of the new room detection system

**Limitations:**

Masking now works even without sight but remember to wall of the edges of your map or it won't work

**Fallback Mode**

The option has been depreciated in favor of the new room detection system

Remember to use an overehead tile with Fade mode for best results
