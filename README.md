# Better-Roofs
A Foundry VTT module to improve roof behaviour

A very simple module with two features:

- Lets you peek "under" roofs to see the room inside
- Shows the whole roof through the fog

How to use: Set an overhead tile in "Fade" mode (not in roof mode) and everything else should be hadled automatically
